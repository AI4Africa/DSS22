Data Science School 2022 
=============================

## Objectives
The industry interest and adoption of data science continues to grow as it leverages big data to achieve higher levels of business value. During this third edition of Data Science School combined with the fourth edition of Business Intelligence & Semantic Web seminar, participants will learn and put in practice solutions around recent data science concepts, tools, and techniques for data collection, ingestion, transformation, and consolidation.

At the end of the school, the participants should be able to :
- Understand the main concepts and techniques behind big data frameworks and architectures, 
- Practice machine learning pipelines implementation
- Use data science tools and systems
- Practice data visualization tools
- Use knowledge engineering tools
- Understand semantic web paradigm.

## Participants
IT professionals, engineers, consultants, students interested in Data Science and Business Intelligence concepts along with their practices.
