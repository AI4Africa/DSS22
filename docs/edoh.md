## Abstract 

1.	**Patient-centric data in emergency care**
This workshop will discuss the difference between patient-centric and patient-centered data and to what extent they could support personalized emergency care.
Emergency data collection is commonly a manual process. 
Emergency care is a critical medical field. The time, availability and accuracy of contextual information are important parameters that affect the outcome of emergency care delivery. 
In the event of an emergency call, the accuracy of information exchanged is vital to the success of emergency care. The exchange of information or data collected during an emergency transport is also critical to the success of follow-up treatment at the emergency hospital. However, the information provided during emergency care is often inaccurate. During an emergency transport, the processing of data and information collection is essentially manual and time-consuming. Emergency physicians usually do not have access to patients' medical records. As a result, emergency care is still patient-centered rather than patient-centric.
This workshop presents a patient-centric delivery of urgent care services based on information collected through an IoHT system combined with medical provided by an EHR.  The data collected through this system are analyzed and compared to the traditional ones.
ANOVA was used to test the link (correlation) between the rate of the emergency care delivery success and the source of data used

2.	**Technology support for long-term care in home settings**
The nursing shortage is a worldwide healthcare-service-delivery crisis. Modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is increasingly being introduced in the Long-Term Care (LTC) to assist older adults to independently aging-in-place. Though the contribution of technologies to mitigate nursing shortage is less investigated. 
This workshop will discuss, in the light of data collected in frame of an empirical study, the potentialities multidimensional smart home automation technology to facilitate aging in place and thus to contribute to mitigation the crisis.
