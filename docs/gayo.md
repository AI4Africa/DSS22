## Abstract 
Nowadays, the healthcare sector is experiencing an abundance of digitalized data to enable digital health and efficient health related decision making. However, in the global south, in particular Africa, the lack of reliable health related information makes it difficult to develop effective health policies.

In this talk I will address some issues that the global south usually experience in designing and implementing reliable digital health systems. I will address in particular some multidisciplinary works related to bringing semantic technologies and AI based approaches that are conducted to enable digital public health.
